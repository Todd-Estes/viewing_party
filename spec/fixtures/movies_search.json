But Brody has his own problems trying to hold a dying town together. Miracle after miracle takes place and the residents of Promise embrace the boy... Written by Mike Norris",

Literally central to a memorable show is a revolving stage that sees Gabriel going for a cycle ride in an exuberant \"Solsbury Hill,\" performing \"Growing Up\" inside a Zorb ball, and delivering a gravity-defying sky walk in \"Downside Up\" with daughter Melanie. Accompanied by regular sidemen David Rhodes (guitar) and Tony Levin (bass), Gabriel is joined by the legendary Blind Boys of Alabama for the spine-tingling \"Sky Blue,\" throughout mixing recent tracks like the abrasive \"Darkness\" and \"The Barry Williams Show\" with established crowd pleasers such as \"Red Rain,\" \"In Your Eyes,\" and \"Sledgehammer.",
