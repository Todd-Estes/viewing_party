        sequel to the first movie. In something more meditative and unhurried, in
        something more philosophically meaningful than its legendary predecessor.
        Backstage games and backstage talks replaced the dramatic mood swings of the
        main characters and the exchange of fire.\r\n\r\nThe second film continues
        the story of Michael Carleone in the role of the Godfather, and also complements
        the family story with scenes of the formation of the young Vito Andolini and
        his escape to America. The difficult choice of being young Don, his sphere
        of expansion of influence opens up new heights and horizons, but also acquires
        new enemies. Big money and power always keep pace with great temptation, and
        therefore you should always keep your ears open. After all, the knife in the
        back can insert exactly the one from whom you do not expect ...","created_at":"2019-07-30T08:28:10.884Z","id":"5d3fff9ab87aec6aa339e228","updated_at":"2019-07-31T22:33:04.159Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5d3fff9ab87aec6aa339e228"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":2}'
